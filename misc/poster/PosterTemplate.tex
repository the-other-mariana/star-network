% Column environment setup
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If you have N columns, choose \sepwidth and \colwidth such that
% (N+1)*\sepwidth + N*\colwidth = \paperwidth
% Follow structure to create difference column environments. 
\newlength{\sepwidthA} % Seperation distance between comulumns type A
\newlength{\colwidthA} % collumn width type A
\setlength{\sepwidthA}{0.25\paperwidth}
\setlength{\colwidthA}{0.5\paperwidth}

\newcommand{\separatorcolumnA}{\begin{column}{\sepwidthA}\end{column}}

% Second column environment. 
\newlength{\sepwidthB}
\newlength{\colwidthB}
\setlength{\sepwidthB}{0.0666\paperwidth}
\setlength{\colwidthB}{0.4\paperwidth}

\newcommand{\separatorcolumnB}{\begin{column}{\sepwidthB}\end{column}}

% You can also use these column commands to create columns inside columns and for creating new column formatting. 
% You can also have non even columns by creating more column environments or specifying the width when beginning a column environment.

    \begin{block}{Applications}
    An IoT (internet of Things) development example are Smart Cities, where these are defined as the quality of living improvement through the use of hardware, software, networks and data. The question that the prediction model would answer on a wider scale would be if, on a Smart City, whose network is presenting packet loss, the real need is \textit{more routers} or simply a \textit{rearrangement of the network's nodes}, coming from the type of interference it presents.
